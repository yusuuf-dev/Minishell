// fix old/a.out: executing a file by it's relative path doesn't work if the file is in a dir
// check if the builtin functions work properly
// fix the ~{user} ex: ~asoufian
// make the code more readable, 
// store all the needed variables in a struct
// symbolik links !!!!!!! : CD AND PWD
// echo "test something" needs to be handled
- to get the actual output of a command run 'set -x' to unset it run 'set +x'

export:
variables:
	A word consisting solely of letters, numbers, and underscores, and beginning with a letter or underscore. 
	Names are used as shell variable and function names. Also referred to as an identifier.
    also look up if the x-declare in the export means anything
    if I readonly an env variable it becomes declare -rx in the export 

revisit all built-in functions !!!!!!!!!!!

        maybe dup the file name and passe to youssef's function that handles quotes ? I assumed this (this won't work cuz the shell doesn't use the same logic) cuz
